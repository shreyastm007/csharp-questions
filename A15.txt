8. name all c# access modifiers
In C#, there are 4 basic types of access modifiers.

public:When we declare a type or type member public, 
it can be accessed from anywhere.

private:When we declare a type member with the private 
access modifier, it can only be accessed within the same class.

protected:When we declare a type member as protected, it can 
only be accessed from the same class and its derived classes.

internal:
When we declare a type or type member as internal, it can be accessed only 
within the same assembly.

An assembly is a collection of types (classes, interfaces, etc) 
and resources (data). They are built to work together and form a
 logical unit of functionality.
