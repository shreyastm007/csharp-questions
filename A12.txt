1.Routing:
Routing is the process of directing an HTTP request to a controller.

ASP.NET Core controllers use the Routing middleware to match the URLs 
of incoming requests and map them to actions.

MapControllerRoute is used to create a single route. The single 
route is named default route. Most apps with controllers and views 
use a route template similar to the default route.

2.Session.
Session is a feature in ASP.NET Core that enables us to save/store 
the user data.

Session stores the data in the dictionary on the Server and SessionId 
is used as a key. The SessionId is stored on the client at cookie. 
The SessionId cookie is sent with every request.

The SessionId cookie is per browser and it cannot be 
shared between the browsers.

There is no timeout specified for SessionId cookie and they 
are deleted when the Browser session ends.
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session package provides middleware 
to manage the sessions in ASP.NET Core. 

We need to call "AddSession" method in ConfigureServices 
method of startup class.
The "AddSession" method has one overload method, which accepts 
various session options such as Idle Timeout, Cookie Name and 
Cookie Domain etc.

 The default session timeout at the Server is 20 minutes but 
it is configurable.
