1. Try writing test cases on each of the assert method

2. what is the difference time of 3 zones from utc 

3. what do u mean by DST in c# date and time object

4. Explain different kinds of date (Unspecified, UTC and local)

5. Explain functional programming approach and its benefits.

You can say FP is used to eliminate code redundancies and to 
create a better coding style.
By allowing functions to be passed as parameters the code 
will be greatly reduced and makes your programming more abstract and reusable.

Here are the main characteristics of any functional programming language:
First-Class Functions
Higher-Order Functions
Pure Functions
Currying or Partial Application
Recursion
Pattern Matching
Memoization

Optimum Transparency. 

Lazy Evaluation
          

Enhanced Readability

Static Variables 

Seamless Parallel Programming

Validating Functional Signatures


Conclusion:To summarize the advantages of functional programming, 
the user can use mathematics-like values and functions to yield results 
that have no outside influence and is well-evaluated throughout.

6. Write a c# program to extract date property and display 
date and time value in formatted output (your own format)

7. Write a c# program to get day of a week for a specified date
