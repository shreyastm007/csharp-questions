1. Explain the Execution Flow of a .net application?

CLR contains a component called Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) which 
will convert the Intermediate language into native code which can be 
understood by the underlying operating system.
The two major components of . NET Framework are the Common Language 
Runtime (CLR) and the . NET Framework Class Library. 
The CLR is the execution engine that handles running applications.

2. Difference between MySQL and SQL server?

a)However, SQL server is more secure than MySQL. 
It does not let any process to access and 
manipulate the database files at run time. 

b)Developed by Microsoft.	Developed by Oracle.

c)Expects a large amount of operational storage space.	
Expects less amount of operational storage space.

d)MySQL is free to use.	SQL Server is costly.

-------------------------
3. Difference between ASP.net and ASP.net core?

a)Asp.Net Build for Windows	
Asp.Net Core Build for Windows, Mac and Linux

b)Asp.Net has a Good Performance
ASP.Net core has higher performances than ASP.Net

c)We Need to re-compile after the code change.	
Core Browser refresh will compile and executed the code 
no need for re-compile.

d)Based on .NET framework only.
Based on .NET and Core framework.

4. What is Meta Package?

A 'meta-package' is a convenient way to bulk-install groups of 
applications, their libraries and documentation.
Metapackages describe a set of packages that are used together.

5. Can a ASP.net application work with lower version of .net framework
Yes.

6. What does .li file means?
The LI$ file type is primarily associated with MS Compressed Library. 
LI$ File extension: LI$ File type: MS Compressed Library files.

7. What is ILAssembler and ILDissassembler?

The IL Assembler generates a portable executable (PE) file from 
intermediate language (IL) assembly.You can 
run the resulting executable, which contains IL and the required 
metadata, to determine whether the IL performs as expected.
This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio.

The Portable Executable (PE) format is a file format for executables, 
object code, DLLs and others used in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems. 

Syntax:ilasm [options] filename [[options]filename...]

The IL Disassembler is a companion tool to the IL Assembler 
(Ilasm.exe). Ildasm.exe takes a portable executable (PE) file 
that contains intermediate language (IL) code and creates a 
text file suitable as input to Ilasm.exe. 
This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio.
Syntax:ildasm [options] [PEfilename] [options]

8. What is Monolithic Application?

They're typically complex applications.a monolithic application 
describes a single-tiered software application 
in which the user interface and data access code are combined 
into a single program from a single platform. 

For example, consider a monolithic ecommerce SaaS application. 
It might contain a web server, a load balancer, 
a catalog service that services up product images, 
an ordering system, a payment function, and a shipping component.
