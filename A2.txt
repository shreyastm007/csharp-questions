1.what is c sharp?

C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. 
C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET.

2.Diff b/w class and struct?

a)Classes are of reference types.Structs are of value types.

b)All the reference types are allocated on heap memory. 
All the value types are allocated on stack memory.

c)Class has limitless features.	Struct has limited features.

d)Class is generally used in large programs.	Struct are used in small programs.

e)Classes can contain constructor or destructor.	
Structure does not contain parameter less constructor or destructor,
 but can contain Parameterized constructor or static constructor.

f)Classes used new keyword for creating instances.
Struct can create an instance, with or without new keyword.

g)A Class can inherit from another class.	
A Struct is not allowed to inherit from another struct or class.

h)The data member of a class can be protected.	The data member of struct can’t be protected.

i)Function member of the class can be virtual or abstract.	
Function member of the struct cannot be virtual or abstract.

3.What are classes and objects in c#?

1.class:Blueprint of variables and methods. Group of classes are namespace. Group of objects.
2.object:Instance of a class. Memory representation of blueprint.

4. Explain different  access modifiers in c#? FINAL, STATIC, ABSTRACT

Access modifiers are keywords used to specify the declared accessibility of a member or a type.
1. public: Access isn't restricted.

2. protected: Access is limited to the containing class or types derived from 
   the containing class.

3. internal: Access is limited to the current assembly.

4. protected internal: Access is limited to the current assembly or types derived 
   from the containing class.

5. private: Access is limited to the containing type.

6. private protected: Access is limited to the containing class or types derived 
from the containing class within the current assembly.

7. file: The declared type is only visible in the current source file. 
File scoped types are generally used for source generators.

5. Explain different access specifiers in c#

To define the scope and visibility of a class member, use an access specifier.

C# supports the following access specifiers −

Public
Private
Protected
Internal
Protected internal


Public Access Specifier:
It allows a class to expose its member variables and member functions to other functions 
and objects.

Private Access Specifier:
Private access specifier allows a class to hide its member variables and 
member functions from other functions and objects. Only functions of the 
same class can access its private members.

Protected Access Specifier:
Protected access specifier allows a child class to access the member variables 
and member functions of its base class.

Internal Access Specifier:
Internal access specifier allows a class to expose its member variables and 
member functions to other functions and objects in the current assembly.

Protected Internal Access Specifier:
The protected internal access specifier allows a class to hide its member variables 
and member functions from other class objects and functions, except a child class 
within the same application.

6. Explain different data types in c#?

Value Types: int, float, char, bool,enum,struct.
Reference Types:class type, interface type, array type, delegate type.

----------
7. What is debugging?
the process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software by 
using break points.

----------
8.explain the use of using statement in c#(imp)
======================================
The using statement causes the object itself to go out of scope as soon as Dispose is called.
Within the using block, the object is read-only and can't be modified or reassigned. 
A variable declared with a using declaration is read-only.

----------
9. Explain all the looping  statments in c#?

a)For Loop:
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop
Syntax

for( initialization; condition; increment or decrement)
{
//Statements
}

b)While Loop:
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is True:
 

Syntax:

//Initialization;
while(condition)
{
//Statements;
//Increment or decrement;
}

c)Do While:
The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, 
before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as 
long as the condition is true.

Syntax

//Initialization;
do
{
//Statements;
//Increment or decrement;
}while(condition);

10. Diff b/w ternary operator and null coalescing operator with examples?

Ternary operator:
C# includes a decision-making operator ?: which is called the conditional operator or 
ternary operator. It is the short form of the if else conditions.
The ternary operator starts with a boolean condition. If this condition evaluates to true 
then it will execute the first statement after ?, 
otherwise the second statement after : will be executed.


Null-coalescing operator:
It will return the value of its left-hand operand if it is not null. If it is null, then 
it will evaluate the right-hand operand and returns its result. Or 
if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null,then it does not evaluate its right-hand operand.
The ?? operator is used to check null values and you can also assign a 
default value to a variable whose value is null(or nullable type).
