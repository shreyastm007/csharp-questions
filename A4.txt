2. WACP to find sum of all elements in an array?
-----

3. WACP to duplicate the no of elements in an array?
-----

4. WACP to perform all types of sorting : bubble sort,insertion sort, 
selection sort, quick sort, merge sort and heap sort.

5. WACP to insert new value in to an array ?
a)Array Index Initializer
b)Array.SetValue() Method
c)by Using Lists

6. Explain jagged multidimensional array, process of initialisation 
and accessing ?

7. Explain use of ? In c#?
------

8. WACP for while and do-while looping using an array?
------

9. Can we use for- each loop in multidimensional array, if not why? 
 However, with multidimensional arrays, using a nested for loop gives 
you more control over the order in which to process the array elements.
Simply use two nested for loops.

10. Try if you can hide or shadow the virtual methods?
C# also provides a concept to hide the methods of the base class from 
derived class, this concept is known as Method Hiding. It is also known 
as Method Shadowing. 
In method hiding, you can hide the implementation of the methods of 
a base class from the derived class using the new keyword.
