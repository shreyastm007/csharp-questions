2. Explain aggregation and composition

Composition in C#
Under Composition, if the parent object is deleted, 
then the child object also loses its status.

The composition is a special type of Aggregation and gives a 
part-of relationship.

For example, A Car has an engine. If the car is destroyed, 
the engine is destroyed as well.

Aggregation in C#
Aggregation is a direct relation between objects in C#. 
It is the relationship between objects.

For example, Employee and Department.

An Employee is associated with a single Department, 
whereas a Department can have more than one employee

3. Explain mapping in ASP.NET
It is a convention-based object-to-object mapper that requires 
very little configuration. The object-to-object mapping works by 
transforming an input object of one type into an output object 
of a different type.
AutoMapper in C# is a library used to map data from one object to another. 
It acts as a mapper between two objects and transforms one object type 
into another. It converts the input object of one type to the output object 
of another type until the latter type follows or maintains the conventions
 of AutoMapper.

4. Explain loose and tight coupling

Tight coupling means classes and objects are dependent on one another. 
In general, tight coupling is usually not good because it reduces the 
flexibility and re-usability of the code while Loose coupling means 
reducing the dependencies of a class that uses the different class directly.

6. Explain dependency injection.
A dependency is an object that another object depends on.
 It is a useful technique that makes testing easier, 
as it allows you to mock the dependencies.
