1. What is payload?

When data is sent over the internet, it spits out to two pieces of information, 
overhead and payload.The overhead information is removed from the view once it 
reaches its destination. 
 
The payload of an API is the data you are interested in transporting to the 
server when you make an API request.It is the body of your 
HTTP request and response message.

ex:imagine sending the message, "Hello" and 
labeling it "msg". "Hello" is referred to as the payload 
and "msg" is the overhead. Once the overhead and payload reach their destination, 
the only data that is viewable is "Hello". The label "msg" is only used for 
internal purposes to identify your data.
  
The payload of an API can be sent or received in various formats such as 
JSON or XML. 
In a query string, the payload can usually be identified using curly braces "{}".
