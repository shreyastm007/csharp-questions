1. What is helper class
A Helper class is a lesser known code 
where a coder has identified some miscellaneous, 
commonly used operations and attempted to make 
them reusable by lumping them together in an 
unnatural grouping.

3. Explain kestrel web server

Kestrel is an open source, cross platform
and a default webserver used for Asp.Net Core applications. 
Asp.
Kestrel is event-driven, asynchronous I/O based server used to host 
ASP.NET applications on any platform. 

It was built to be fast; in fact, itâ€™s six times faster 
than node.js for static and plain text operations.

Kestrel has support on all platforms and versions 
supported by .NET Core. When 
you create a new project in Visual Studio, your 
project is automatically configured to run in Kestrel.

Net Core applications run Kestrel webserver as  
server to handle web request.
 Kestrel does 
not have every advanced features of webservers like IIS, 
 Apache, etc has. Due to its lightweight nature, 
Kestrel provides better request processing performance 
to Asp.Net Core applications.
 


4. Explain the difference between asp.net core 
   and asp.net .

a)Asp.Net Build for Windows	
Asp.Net Core Build for Windows, Mac and Linux

b)Asp.Net has a Good Performance	
ASP.Net core has higher performances than ASP.Net.

c)Asp.Net Supports WebForm, Asp.Net MVC and Asp.Net WebAPI.	
Asp.Net Core does not support WebForm. It supports MVC, Web API and 
Asp.Net Web pages originally added in .Net Core 2.0.

d)Support C#, VB and many other languages and also support WCF, WPF and WF	
Support only C#, F# language. VB support to added a short time and 
no support WCF, WPF and WF but support for WCF client libraries are available.


e)Asp.Net MVC application added Web.config, Global.asax, Application Start.	
Core did not support Web.config and Global.asax files. 
It has supporting appsettings.json.

f)We Need to re-compile after the code change.	
Core Browser refresh will compile and executed the 
code no need for re-compile.
